<div class="center">St. Augustine convent college, founded in 1972 by Maria Fernandez, is dedicated to academic excellence and personal growth. With a passion for empowering students and fostering academic excellence, Maria sought to create an institution that would provide a holistic learning environment. Her commitment to inclusive education ensured that students from various backgrounds could access opportunities for personal and professional development. Under her leadership, our college quickly gained recognition for its rigorous academic standards and dedicated faculty. The college began with a modest enrollment and a few key programs, but Maria’s vision and dedication drove its growth and expansion over the years. Today, this college stands as a testament to Maria Fernandez’s founding principles, continuing to provide high-quality education and fostering a supportive community for students to thrive. Our experienced faculty and modern facilities create a supportive learning environment, empowering students to achieve their goals and make a positive impact in the world. And now, we would like to present an overview of our college for your consideration.</div>
